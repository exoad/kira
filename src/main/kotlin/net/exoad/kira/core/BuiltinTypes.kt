/**
 * Builtin types that are although available at source level are builtin "direct" types
 * that the compiler is always aware of.
 *
 * Type precedence is an implied concept that means the likelihood of this type being
 * converted to one with higher precedence.
 *
 * For example. a float and an integer together in an arithmetic expr will always
 * equate to a float without specific casting. This is because floats in general will
 * have a higher precedence than integers. On the other hand, there is also precedence
 * within type groups themselves.
 *
 * For example, an expr adding an Int32 and an Int64 will always equate to an Int64
 * without specific casting that involves truncating.
